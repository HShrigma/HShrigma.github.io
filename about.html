            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I'm Hristo, a game developer with a <b>BSc in Computer Science</b>. I specialize in creating dynamic,
                immersive gameplay experiences. With over four years of experience using <b>Unity</b>, I have honed my
                skills in <b>C#</b> and <b>C++</b>, while currently exploring <b>Unreal Engine</b> through a combination
                of <b>C++</b> and blueprints.</p>
            <p>My journey into game development has been enriched by my studies at the <b>University of London</b>,
                where I embraced various technical and creative challenges. I believe in fostering a collaborative
                learning environment, always striving to uplift my peers and share knowledge to benefit the entire team.

            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have developed a broad skill set that encompasses various programming languages
                and frameworks. My strongest skills include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C#</b> and <b>C++</b> for game development</li>
                <li>Expertise in <b>Unity</b> and <b>Unreal Engine</b>, utilizing both <b>C++</b> and blueprints</li>
                <li>Version control experience with <b>Git</b> and <b>Plastic</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Creating engaging game <b>AI</b> is a core focus of my work. I have implemented <b>FSM</b> and
                priority-based <b>HFSM</b> to bring intelligent and challenging behaviors to life, especially through
                adaptive mechanics and dynamic interactions. My passion extends to crafting immersive experiences with
                responsive controls, fluid animations, and engaging physics interactions.</p>

        <section class="interests">
            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>From a young age, I was captivated by game <b>AI</b>, which seemed like black magic that brought games to
                life. It was the first aspect of development I wanted to understand, and I still love deepening my
                knowledge in this area. I'm currently reading <b>Game AI Pro</b>, focusing on concepts like <b>Behaviour
                    Trees</b>, <b>GOAP</b>, <b>Utility AI</b>, and <b>HTN</b>.</p>
            <p>I see video games as a unique artistic medium and strive to create mechanics that feel intuitive and
                rewarding to use. My focus on <b>game design</b> includes crafting solid <b>game design documents
                    (GDD)</b> and conducting playtesting sessions to gather user feedback, ensuring that my designs
                resonate with players.</p>
            <p>Dedicated to code quality and optimization, I embrace <b>SOLID</b> principles, frequent refactoring, and
                debugging sessions. This commitment to clear, maintainable code fosters collaboration and establishes
                best practices within teams. I'm also enthusiastic about optimizing <b>performance</b>, utilizing
                profiling tools, and pushing for minimal overhead, especially in creating efficient shaders and managing
                memory.</p>

        <section class="journey">
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My love for games started at age 6 when I began emulating retro games. By 15, I was playing titles like
                <b>Dark Souls</b>, <b>Mount & Blade</b>, <b>Crusader Kings</b>, and <b>The Binding of Isaac</b>, which
                truly sparked my appreciation for games as an artistic medium. I often watched <b>GDC</b> talks,
                aspiring to develop the same level of skill and technical mastery as industry professionals.
            </p>
            <p>At 18, during the first COVID lockdown, I developed my first 2D platformer. While working as a technical
                support analyst, I co-founded <b>Black Sea Trident</b>, a small indie team where we worked on game
                projects in our spare time. This experience motivated me to leave that job and pursue a <b>BSc in
                    Computer Science</b>, where I gained a deeper understanding of <b>mathematics</b>, <b>physics</b>,
                <b>OOP</b>, <b>game development</b>, <b>engine architecture</b>, and <b>3D graphics programming</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Game development has been my career goal from the beginning, and personal projects have taught me
                invaluable lessons about balancing scope, optimizing systems, and refining gameplay mechanics. I
                continually push my technical skills through rapid prototyping and mastering new programming techniques
                to ensure each game delivers satisfying and polished experiences. While I'm a programmer at heart, I
                hold a special love for game design, art, and sound, as great games are created through love and
                collaboration across multiple disciplines.</p>
