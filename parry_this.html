                    <h2>Player Controls</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>Players need an intuitive control system that allows for complex player expression without
                            overwhelming them, providing "easy to learn, hard to master" mechanics.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>I developed a responsive player control system with several core elements:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>8-Directional Movement</strong>: Allows players predictable positioning to scan
                                for
                                enemies without being limited in movement options.</li>
                            <li><strong>One-Button Combos</strong>: Players can chain up to three attacks, where each
                                subsequent strike has a longer but narrower hitbox, accommodating diverse playstyles.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Dash Mechanic</strong>: Players disable their hitbox for a quick reposition when
                                parrying isn’t viable, adding a defensive option. Recovery time and a cooldown prevent
                                overuse, encouraging strategic timing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quality of Life Enhancements</strong>: Animation-based input buffers allow
                                smoother
                                combo transitions. Separately, movement adjustments provide players with nuanced control
                                mid-animation, creating a rhythm-based challenge that’s rewarding without sacrificing
                                gameplay flow.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Enemy Types</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>I wanted enemies to introduce mechanics organically and encourage aggressive play.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>I designed nine distinct enemy types, each serving a different challenge:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Melee and Elite Melee</strong>: Introduce the basics of parrying, making melee
                                encounters the foundation for constant movement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ranged Enemies (Gun and Uzi)</strong>: Train players in prioritizing targets,
                                requiring precise parries and establishing the concept of “priority targets.”</li>
                            <li><strong>Grenadiers (Normal and Elite)</strong>: Act as chaos agents, allowing players to
                                deflect grenades when timed precisely, adding layers to positioning and timing
                                challenges.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Bazooka Enemies</strong>: These final, high-stakes enemies use target-seeking
                                rockets, providing a significant end-game challenge.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>Enemy Management Systems</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>With increasing enemy types, it was crucial to manage spawns in a way that felt fair,
                            predictable, and challenging without overwhelming players.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>I used an enemy manager to handle spawns, adjusting counts and placements to balance
                            gameplay.
                            Drawing from <em>Game AI Pro</em>, I moved beyond uniform random spawning and implemented
                            <strong>Dynamic Weighted Random Ratios</strong>, balancing unique runs with fairness.

                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>Initial prototypes made enemies predictable and easy to exploit. To manage the varied enemy
                            AI
                            behaviors effectively, I needed a flexible but logical system that supported diverse
                            tactics.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>I chose a custom Priority-Based HFSM architecture, giving the AI flexibility with logical,
                            weighted priorities for actions. This solution included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Architecture</strong>: By making HFSM priority-based, it moves closer to
                                industry-standard solutions like Behavior Trees, balancing simplicity with adaptability.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Pathfinding</strong>: Implemented a vector-based navigation system which weighs
                                vectors based on target or obstacle proximity, allowing agents to pathfind using A*
                                while
                                dynamically avoiding others by adjusting their priority based on proximity to the player
                                character.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variance</strong>: Added randomized behavior variance for minor action
                                fluctuations,
                                which prevents repetitive patterns and creates engaging encounters.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>Creating a polished mechanic is built with meaningful sound, visual feedback, and mechanics
                            that
                            engage players, yet without certain tactile hardware limitations, some polish elements
                            weren't
                            achievable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>Deadlines did not allow for game controller testing, so tactile feedback like rumble wasn't
                            possible. However, I was successful in implementing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>VFX</strong>: Using SOLID principles, I created management scripts for my 40+
                                handcrafted VFX, which allowed for simple VFX triggers without changing existing
                                character
                                logic. I expanded with UI indicators for attack time and type, off-screen indicators,
                                and HP
                                icons. This brought a sweet spot between my original idea for diegetic health
                                representation
                                through armor breaks and clear visual communication during chaotic multi-fights.</li>
                            <li><strong>SFX</strong>: I recorded and/or mixed various sound effects and composed music
                                loops
                                in FL Studio 12. FMOD is planned for future projects for greater adaptive sound control.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cinematic Effects</strong>: Effects like time dilation and controlled screen
                                shakes
                                intrinsically reward the player and reinforce impactful moments.</li>

                        <p>As development progressed, the game faced significant performance issues, particularly with
                            graphical rendering and memory usage.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Visual Optimization</strong>: I optimized materials, for example - bullets move
                                so
                                fast that an unlit shader looked identical to a lit one on them, but saved performance
                                time.
                                In order to eliminate the complexity of an opaque and transparent render queue, I
                                introduced
                                custom dithering shaders to introduce door-to-door transparency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: I reduced garbage collection time from 5ms to
                                0.02ms,
                                replacing GetComponent calls with serialized fields or singletons to minimize CPU
                                overhead.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Asynchronous Scene Loading</strong>: My loading screen is a reusable scene for
                                any
                                scene-to-scene transition, making scene transitions seamless and optimized.</li>

                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>To create a cohesive art style, I avoided asset packs or generative AI, designing 3D and 2D
                            assets from scratch. Only a few floor and wall textures were sampled from AmbientCG. While a
                            good start, I needed something more distinct than just a low-poly 3D game.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                            <li><strong>Custom Visual Assets</strong>: I aimed for a stylized, handcrafted aesthetic
                                that
                                reflects the game’s tone and themes. I ensured the UI is always animated and includes
                                smooth
                                transitions for a polished finish.</li>
                            <li><strong>UI Optimization</strong>: Since I wanted to stylize every component, I used a UI
                                Camera instead of the default Overlay, allowing for post-processing effects and ensuring
                                visual cohesion across all game elements.</li>
