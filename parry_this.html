            <p>An intense parry-based combat game with precise mechanics and animations.</p>
            
            <!-- Feature 1: FSM-based Enemy AI -->
            <section class="feature">
                <h3>Feature 1: FSM-based Enemy AI</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Creating AI behaviors that feel responsive to player actions and deliver strategic, varied challenges in combat.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Designed a finite state machine (FSM) for each enemy type, enabling dynamic responses based on player proximity, attack timing, and defense strategies. This system allowed for efficient state transitions, making the AI feel responsive and complex yet manageable.</p>

            <!-- Feature 2: Animation Syncing -->
            <section class="feature">
                <h3>Feature 2: Animation Syncing</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Achieving a high degree of responsiveness between player input and animations, essential for a game that rewards precision timing.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Synchronized input-driven animations with precise timing, blending between states for smoother transitions. This approach resulted in an immersive and responsive gameplay experience, making every parry and counterattack feel impactful.</p>

            <!-- Feature 3: Game Feel Improvements -->
            <section class="feature">
                <h3>Feature 3: Game Feel Enhancements</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Enhancing player immersion and feedback without distracting from the core combat experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented visual effects (VFX), adaptive post-processing, and refined sound cues that respond to player actions. This combination amplified the sense of impact and satisfaction, ensuring that every successful parry and strike resonated with the player.</p>
