                Me and the team at Black Sea Trident are working on an exciting, narrative-driven mystery game for our artist's MA final project. Players take on the role of detective Stephen Case, unraveling a murder mystery in a twisted amusement park with real-world cryptography puzzles. Our prototype has established core systems like dynamic inventory and item mechanics with physics-based interactions, laying the groundwork for smoother mechanics and immersive gameplay. We’re continuing to refine the experience in our free time, focusing on quality, player immersion, and rapid prototyping, while teaching and using Git for version control across the team.

                Tower of Danger is a 2D tower defense game built for fast-paced, tactical combat, where players experiment with seven unique unit types to defend their base. As our first project, I was responsible for combat AI, damage systems, cannon physics, UI, and even basic VFX and particle systems. Despite its roughness, the game holds a special place in my heart, reminding me of simpler times and the thrill of finishing my first project with a team.

                Created as a 2-day university project, Slime Slayer challenged me to turn a basic 3D scene into a small but engaging game, blending my early Blender rig animations with Unity’s FSM for smoother movement and enemy AI. I designed a player input manager, a basic scoring and wave-tracking system, and some key animations. The limitations of this project taught me critical lessons that carried over to Parry This! on polish, camera work, and reward systems.

                A 2-day university project, this physics-based bowling game was a fun exercise in realism, built to simulate the exact feel of a real bowling lane with custom physics materials, pin reactions, and a directional power meter. I applied SOLID principles to make the code base manageable, and was surprised at how quickly I could produce a playable game. Feedback on the final game helped me see how true-to-life simulation doesn’t always equal playability, shifting my approach toward balancing realism with player enjoyment.
